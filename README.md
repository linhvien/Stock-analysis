# Stock-analysis
I scrape financial data and historical data of Vietnamese stocks from vietstock and cafef websites. Then, I compute several important financial ratios to conduct industry analysis and business performance over time. I also apply several stock screening filters according to Ben Graham and Canslim to screen good stocks in industry. Then, I apply time-series analysis and machine learning models to predict the stock price.
